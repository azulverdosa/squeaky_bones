## General Info

This is a little mini project of mine that is going to be used as a database of dog and cats with a short list of details. The goal for this database is for me to use in applications in the future that I have on the back burner. I am opening this up for Hactoberfest to allow new developers the chance to make commits. There are some other files in this same repo that are related to random thoughts I've had for applications.

## Project Status

Status: In Progress

## Room for Improvement

Improvement Thoughts:

- Build out detailed list that can be used for vetrinarians or dog daycare, or any other project I can think of
- Open up for Hactoberfest to help jr devs get moving on GtiHub
