## General Info

This is a mini project of mine that is going to be used as mock-data of dogs and cats with a short list of pet details. I plan to use this collection as mock-data in applications that I have on the back burner. I am opening this up for Hacktoberfest to allow new developers the chance to make their first contributions! There are some other files in this same repo that are related to random thoughts I've had for applications.

## Contributions

Any and all contributions are welcome! Have a look around, add some data, make a suggestion, offer a UI design, I'm open to all ideas!

If you are new to the dev world and would like to know where to start, head to the [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](https://github.com/azulverdosa/pet_database/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for some direction!
